This app was developed just to help me learn more about Android programming and I really wanted to know more about the Apollo missions. So I knocked out two birds with one stone and did this. Please email me if you want to add more facts, or help with any of the development.

I debated weather or not to make it open source, but I decided it is better that it be out there for people to look at then just for my
own pride. I hope someone comes along and looks at it. I would love contributers with people who know what they are doing or jsut getting started like me.

Contact me with any questions or ideas or anything.
